  <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
  My life's been magic, seems fantastic<br>
  I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress<br>
  Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it<br>
  You find out that your gold's just plastic<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
  Every day, every night<br>
  I've been thinkin' back on you and I<br>
  Every day, every night<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
  I worked my whole life<br>
  Just to get right, just to be like<br>
  <u>"Look at me, I'm never comin' down"</u><br>
  I worked my whole life<br>
  Just to get high, just to realise<br>
  Everything I need is on the<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong><br>
  On the ground<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  (Yeah, what goes up must come down)<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  (You're runnin' out of time)<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Verse 2]</strong><br>
  My world's been hectic, seems electric<br>
  But I've been wakin' up with your voice in my head<br>
  And I'm tryna send a message and let you know<br>
  That every single minute I'm without you, I regret it<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
  Every day, every night<br>
  I've been thinkin' back on you and I<br>
  Every day, every night<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>Chorus]</strong><br>
  I worked my whole life<br>
  Just to get right, just to be like<br>
  <u>"Look at me, I'm never comin' down"</u><br>
  I worked my whole life<br>
  Just to get high, just to realise<br>
  Everything I need is on the<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong><br>
  On the ground<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  (Yeah, what goes up must come down)<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  (You're runnin' out of time)<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Bridge]</strong><br>
  I'm way up in the clouds<br>
  And they say I've made it now<br>
  But I figured it out<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground (Yeah, yeah)<br>
  Just drove by your house (Just drove by your house)<br>
  So far from you now (So far from you now)<br>
  But I figured it out<br>
  Everything I need is on the<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Outro]</strong><br>
  On the ground<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  On the ground<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">
