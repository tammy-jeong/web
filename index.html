  <p><strong>[Verse 1]</strong><br>
  My life's been magic, seems fantastic<br>
  I used to have a hole in the wall with a mattress<br>
  Funny when you want it, suddenly you have it<br>
  You find out that your gold's just plastic<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Pre-Chorus]</strong><br>
  Every day, every night<br>
  I've been thinkin' back on you and I<br>
  Every day, every night<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Chorus]</strong><br>
  I worked my whole life<br>
  Just to get right, just to be like<br>
  <u>"Look at me, I'm never comin' down"</u><br>
  I worked my whole life<br>
  Just to get high, just to realise<br>
  Everything I need is on the<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">

  <p><strong>[Post-Chorus]</strong><br>
  On the ground<br>
  Everything I need is on the ground<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  (Yeah, what goes up must come down)<br>
  Nah, but they don't hear me though<br>
  (You're runnin' out of time)<br></p><p style="margin-top:40px;">
